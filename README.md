# hello-world
This is my first repository so I can get used to using GitHub.

26/08/15 12:44pm: This is the first time I have edited this file.

26/08/15 13:04pm: I've recently done a screen cast about git. To try and bring pull requests into my current model, this is how i undersatnd pull requests. Pull requests are a unique part of GitHub because GitHub is designed for multiple people colaborating on a project. Pull requests don't have to be completed to merge the branch. They are an additional feature of GitHub to help collaborators.
